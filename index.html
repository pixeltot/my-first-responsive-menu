<p>Basically what we have hear is a set of links.</p>
<p>Usually the thing to do is do embed a list into an unordered list, 
<br>
however since we are doing a responsive based menu I have decided to just embed links in a div and have those divs float right of each other and take up a percentage of width: 
<br>
based on screen size you can have a different amount of links per row.</p>

<p>Resizing the browser window will allow you to see the desired effect!</p>
